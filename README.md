More up-to-date implementations of the problems hosted on Project Euler, written in C++.

This is meant to be an improved version of [my original take on the problems](https://github.com/chiragbharadwaj/euler), written when I was in high school and had about 3 months of experience with computer programming. I decided to revisit these problems five years later to see if I have improved in any considerable capacity as a graduate student in computer science. Wish me luck!

I would still like to know if any of the solutions that I have constructed can be reasonably optimized. Feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:chiragb@cs.princeton.edu) or submit a pull request if you feel that any of my solutions are inefficient or disingenuous to the spirit of the contest.

Thanks y'all!
